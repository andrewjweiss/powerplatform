# Design System

## Overview 

As my background is in visual design, I focused initially on creating a design system and toolkit that would let me build and deploy applications and interfaces quickly and efficiently. With a set of guidelines and standard components and assets I could more easily scale development with the addition of new team members. Everything here is open source, take what you want and use it as you wish.

## Principles

### Functional
### Accessible
### Consistent
