# Rapid Application Development with the Microsoft Power Platform. 

Using the Power Platform to design, develop, and deploy custom solutions that integrate with any system and scale with ease. 

I have been using the Power Platform for a couple years now and wanted to share my assets, tools, and techniques. When I first got started with these tools I was able to learn the fundamentals quickly with the help of a great open source community cultivated by Microsoft. 

Working for one of the largest automobile parts manufacturers in North America gave me platform to explore how the Power Platform fits within Industry 4.0 and the Smart Factory. As industries around the world undergo digital transformation, we will have the ability to design innovative and functional applications to automate the boring stuff and enjoy what we do. 

My background is almost entirely in UI/UX, digital marketing, brand development, and visual design. The Power Platform allowed me to iterate on my ideas and deploy actual real world solutions. I can't guarantee that the way I have done it is the best way, especially when it comes to the back end so take whats here if you want and build on it.
